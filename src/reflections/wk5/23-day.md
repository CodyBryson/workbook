## What is a virtual property?

A virtual property is an object's property that exists virtually but is never added to the collection. They do not get persisted within the database.
## When do you use a virtual property?

You use a virtual property when you don't want a static property on a model, but want to be able to take in that information if provided. It also allows you to create an object using that model without putting in the virtual properties.

## How do you search using a virtual propertie's value.

The get method is a built in method for retrieving a virtual property's value. You can also use a set method.
