## What is the purpose of a Query String?

A query string is an appendage to the end of a URL to pass information from the client to the server. It is used to add additional specificity to requests. I.e. getting objects with specific properties that exist within the query string. 
## What's the format of a query parameter, how do you start it and how do you distunguish between one parameter and another?

A query parameter begins at the end of a url and is denoted with a '?'. They are distinguished by key value pairs. You can chain multiple query parameters and can distinguish them with '&'.

## When Query parameters are helpful when writing a server.

Query parameters are extremely helpful by giving the client the option of requesting data with specific parameters. Instead of the client having to sift through every object or array in that specific server model, they can set a query parameter to return only the data that meets the query.
