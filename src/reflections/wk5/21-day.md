## The three types of relationships.

The three types of relationships are one to one, one to many, and many to many. One to one relationships occur where two data sets point to one another. One to many relationships occur when several data sets point to one data set. Many to many relationships occurs when multiple data sets point to multiple other data sets.
## The benefits of linking relationships vs embedding?

Linking relationships is preferred when you need something to manage the relationships between data models. It allows your models to not become bloated as in the case with embedding, and keeps things in separate data collections.

## What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship when you create it?

There are a few challenges in managing a many-to-many relationship. For one, thinking of how the client will interact with the data. Another would be what properties should exist on those models and figuring out how to link them.
