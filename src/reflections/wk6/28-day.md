## What is a nested route?

A nested route is a way to nest components and therefore multiple navigations on a page. They allow for dynamically rendered components and multiple routes on a single page.
## When would you use a nested route?

You would use an nested route when you want to give multiple page component options that vary off another sub route. This allows you to navigate between these pages without having to return back to the home page and start the nav chain all over again.

## Passing parameters through neseted routes and when to use them.

You can absolutely pass params through nested routes. You would do this when you want to pass information that affects the route. One example would be passing the id of a specific component that you would want to navigate to. If you have a list of blogs and want to view a specific blog, you would pass the id of that blog as a param to the route in order to navigate to that specific blog.
