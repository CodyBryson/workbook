## What are lifecycle hooks?

Lifestyle hooks are used to view your code through it's processes. You can view when your components are created, added to the DOM, updated, and destroyed. 
## Why would you use lifecycle hooks?

You would use lifecycle hooks to test your code. Lifecycle hooks can be implemented before you create your component in order to test your code before adding the component. You can also see how your component would react using a lifecycle hook.

## What are mounting hooks and how do you use them?

Mounting hooks are hooks that can be implemented in regards to the rendering of a page. You can place an onmounted hook on a page in order to perform certain functions on page render.
