## What are props?

Props are ways for parents to pass data to a child. Props can be exported and imported in components. 
## How do you use props?

You use props similar to how you pass variables into functions. You create a prop and then pass it into other functions throughout your client. They are originally setup in the template.

## Where can you use props and access them?

The initial creation of a prop is usually inside a template. You can, however, use them outside of templates. They can be used in methods, in hooks, watchers and in computed methods as well.
