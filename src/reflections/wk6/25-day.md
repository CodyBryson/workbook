## Defining Component based architecture.

Component based architecture is encapsulating data into self-sustaining functions. It is basically creating re-usable templates for features you use often in your code. 
## Why would you use component based architecture.

You would use component based architecture if you wanted to dynamically update the page. Because each component makes its own call to the server, that component can refresh its data without affecting the rest of the page.

## Why wouldn't you use component based architecture.

If you try and code ENTIRELY with component based architecture, your code can be bloated. Components should be used when you NEED them, as a resource, not as your entire architecture.
