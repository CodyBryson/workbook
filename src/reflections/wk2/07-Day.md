## The tree ways to syntactically write a function and do they function differently.

The three different ways to syntactically write a function are function declaration, function expression, and arrow functions expressions. The only one of these function types that is hoisted is a function declaration, in which the function can run without being defined. An arrow function expression is a shorter syntax for writing afunction expression.
## The difference between Parameters and Arguments.

A parameter are used to define a function. They reside within the function definition. Arguments are the values received from each parameter. Arguments receive these values once the function is invoked.

## Higher order functions and what they look like.

You can use Var declarations when you need to re-define and update the variable within the function. You can use the Let declaration when you need to update the variable, but not re-define it. And finally you can use the Const declaration when you neither need to re-define or update a variable and need a variable to remain the same throughout the function.
