## Why you should make a plan before writing the code.
This is something I am fortunate not to get into bad habits with. I see several people in the lab when I'm working on a problem, hop straight into their javascript and begin to code a few lines. Then they sit there and stare at the screen-- unsure of where to go next. Planning the basics is something I found extremely helpful when coding. Typically I ask myself, how do I want this program to look-- what are the base features I need to get started. 

I typically begin my project in the html, as it helps me visualize the different elements in the page and how I want the basics to function. From there, I go into my JS and begin writing comments on what I need and why. This planning should only be as far as the basic functions. All the bells and whistles can come later as you begin to react to issues with your original plan or wish to further add onto features.

## Resources for when you're stuck.
There are several resources you can use while coding; colleagues, senior devs, etc. However, the most readily available resource is the good ol' google search. Whenever I don't understand something, the first thing I do is google it to see if someone else had a similar issue. Maybe it's getting an interval to work or figuring out how to create a hover info box. Whatever it is, typically google will have an answer for you.


## My biggest take aways from Into to JS> The Mistakes I Made As a Beginner Programmer.

While this article has a ton of useful information, my biggest takeaway by far is to NOT stick with the first solution you come up with for a problem. Often I find myself coming up with a solution and then trying to shoe horn my code around that solution, even if it is neither the best solution or the easiest. It makes the coding that much more difficult and frustrating trying to code around an inefficient solution. I am going to make an effort to explore other avenues of approach, weigh the pro's and cons and possible issues, before diving right into coding.
