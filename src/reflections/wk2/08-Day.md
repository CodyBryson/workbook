# Day Eight Reflection

## The way you write to a console and when and why you would want to do so.
You can write to the console directly in your java script or by using the chrome developer tools console. Usually, I like to write to a console for each function that is returning information I write in javascript to make sure that the function is returning the appropriate property. Once my code is finished and I begin linking functions to higher order functions, I use the Chrome Dev tools console to check for errors as you will clearly be able to see when your code is throwing errors.

## Debugging with HTML.

On the chrome dev tools, the elements tab allows you to see your html elements and css. This tab is extremely useful in debugging as it allows you to make changes to the DOM as well as test to see what different styling will look like, without having to write it in your code and reloading the page. This tool also shows you the flex box model on each of your elements so that you can see how things are being aligned on your page.

## What is a better way to debug your code outside of writing everything in the console.

Outside of putting a debugger in your js when the console throws an error at a specific line, you can use the sources tab on the chrome dev tools to debug as well. In the sources tab, you can go through your code line-by-line to see what line of code is causing an issue. You can also add breakpoints within this tab or play through them.
