## The three states of a promise.

The three states of a promise are pending, resolved, or rejected. Pending is when the promsie is trying to be fulfilled. Resolved is when the promise completes its task. Rejected is if the promise fails to perform its function. 
## How promises help to prevent callback hell.

Promises can chain callbacks within themselves. This allows for cleaner code and utilize several callbacks within a promise.

## The differences between .then() and .catch().

Then is what a promise will do if it is resolved. A catch is what the promise will do if it is rejected.
