## What are async and await used for?

Async and await are used as syntax for asychronous code. Async functions return a promise. Await will stop the code until the promise is either resolved or rejected. 
## How do you await a promise in a function?

Awaiting a promise is a simple as putting await in front of the function. With await prepended to that function, the code will attempt to either resolve or reject the call.

## Why should you use async and await?

Async and await have several benefits. They are much easier to read, keeping format simple for others to follow. You can chain several asyncs very easily while also keeping it easier to read than regular promises. Debugging promises is also easier with async and await.
