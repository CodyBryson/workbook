# Day Two Reflection

## What is a pseudo-class and what are the most common ones you think you will use?

Git is version control and is used to keep snapshots of your code as you work on a project. It allows you to easily see changes to your code as you update your build. With this in mind, multiple people can work together on the same project and at the same time on different branches of the code. 
## What is specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

Multiple branches allows developers to work on the same code on separate branches. This is done in order to not make changes to the code that another developer is currently working on-- possibily disrupting their workflow. Branches also serve as reference points for when you need to revert to an older version of your code. At any time, a developer can merge their branch in to the main code by using git merge. 

## What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

Git is version control and is used to track changes made to code. Git is stored in your local repository (i.e. your personal computer). However, if you want to share your code so others have access to it (without shouting at Bill to come look at the cool code you wrote on your computer), your code needs to be uploaded to a remote repository. This is where GitHub, a remote repository, comes in. By uploading your code to GitHub, Bill can now access your code from his computer from anywhere with internet access. In the development world, this allows multiple people to view and edit branches of the main code in order to work on a project simutaniously by accessing the code through the remote repositry (Github).
