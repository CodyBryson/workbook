## Why wire-framing is used in the design process.

Wire-framing is the "step one" of the web design process. Getting the idea of the design out there allows you to see how the content will be presented as well as the general structure of the design. It gives the overall idea of how the design will be interacted with, as well as any flaws the design flaws that might crop up by laying out elements in certain ways before you begin the code. This gives you a general structure to begin with when starting the design process. 
## How detailed can wire-frames get?

Wire-frames come in low, medium, and high-fidelity setups. The level of fidelity translates to the level of detail in each design, with low-fidelity wire-frames having barebones or very little detail and high-fidelity wire-frames having the highest level of detail. Low-fidelity wire-frames can be as simple as a quick sketch with pen and paper. High-fidelity wire-frames having the actual images and content for the design on display. 

## Is wire-framing even worth it?

From a design stand-point, I can see the merits of wire-framing a project before beginning. This is the opportunity to create the basic design of a site before you begin to code. Wire-framing also allows clients to see a project before-hand, and make changes or discuss user functionality before it becomes more difficult to change things in the coding process. I would argue that wire-framing more complex and detailed designs is absolutely crucial in the design-phase, where if you have to change something down the road in the coding process, you could break other things in the process-- causing a cascading effect of frustration. Wire-framing at least gets those initial changes out of the way so a developer can stay on task.
