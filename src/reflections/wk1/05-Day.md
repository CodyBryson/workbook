## One week down!

Let me tell you! Coming into this course, I had no idea what to expect. I felt like John Goodman was standing over my shoulder yelling "You're outta your element Donnie!" in the middle of a bowling alley. Surely, I would be behind the majority of my class. These guys get it-- everything just clicks for them. I have since realized that I was drowning without even jumping in the water yet.

As the days went by, I found myself... kind of just relaxing. I think the key is to just take notes, don't try and follow along with the lecture moment by moment. Just watch, listen, and write down things that didn't quite click or you might want to revisit later. I found myself a new friend-- their name is Google and what a pal they turned out to be. I can literally ask them a question and the answer comes back instanteously. What a time to be alive.

Seriously though, googling questions on specific aspects of code netted me with some serious results. Not only that, but those answers typically opened up a rabbit hold to other methods or possible tools to implement. I found myself finally getting comfortable with html and css. Where once I couldn't wrap my head around where the hell you're supposed to put a div; where bootstrap was my mortal enemy and we would do battle at dawn on the next equinox, I discovered the sound of a squeeky hinge as something in my head finally popped open and a firm handshake from the other side that seemed to say 'You got this.'

So, going forward, that's what I'm going to keep in the back of my head. Those three simple words to keep the tension from building up in the shoulders...

You got this.
