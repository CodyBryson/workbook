## Tips to keep your sanity when designing.

For me, starting with the skeleton of the project is the best practice. It allows me to lay out the bones before I fill in the details. Also, working on one section at a time does wonders for your sanity. I like to work from top to bottom after getting the framework done, making sure each piece is functioning. It also allows me to make sure that each section looks good next to the first and keeps the design cohesive.
## What are some good resources when trying to get good web design?

This might be in the box or completely out of the box; but, although it may be super obvious, I tend to literally look at the websites for the top web design businesses. Typically, their work is on display and it helps a ton to see their utilization of features, colors, and design in general. Color is another issue I have trouble with, and sometimes I want to preview a pallete before I apply it to my page. For that, I use themestr.app to create palletes and to see how the colors will look before applying it to my application. Other than that, the bootstrap website has a ton of good resources to use in your designs; from buttons, to nav bars that require very little editing on your part.

## Influencing people through design? What design tells people about your website.

Ever been to just a terribly designed website? I'm talking about a convuluted ugly mess of buttons, pictures, and text just running off the page. What does that say to a consumer visiting your site to make a potential purchase? This is why design is important. You want to convey a sense of trust to a consumer so that they feel secure in their spending. A well designed and structured site conveys a sense of order and trust. Professionalism and appearences are key.
